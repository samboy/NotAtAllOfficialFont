This is a quick and dirty True Type render of a small caps version
of Source Serif Pro (Still a work in process)

Only the normal weight is rendered; if you want more weights, download
and install the free Fontforge, which will happily convert .ofl files
with OpenType small caps in to True Type files. Extra points if you make
a GitHub repo with the converted .ttf files.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL!
I will not keep this up to date with the changes to Source Serif Pro.
If you want that, get Fontforge and do it yourself.

(This used to have a version of Source Serif Pro Italic, but since that
has been released, it now has the small caps version instead)
