This is a quick and dirty True Type render of the font at 
https://github.com/frankrolf/source-serif-pro  Only the normal weight
is rendered; if you want more weights, download and install the free
Fontforge, which will happily convert .ufo files in to .ttf files. Extra
points if you make a GitHub repo with the converted .ttf files.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL AND DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL FORM OF THIS FONT!
I will not keep this up to date with the changes to Source Serif Pro
italic; if you want that, get Fontforge and do it yourself.
