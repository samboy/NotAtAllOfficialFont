This is a quick and dirty True Type render of a small caps version
of Source Serif Pro (Still a work in process)

Only the normal and bold weights are rendered; if you want more weights,
download and install the free Fontforge, which will happily convert .ofl
files with OpenType small caps in to True Type files. Extra points if
you make a GitHub repo with the converted .ttf files.

The font SCTest-regular.otf is a test to make sure a document processor
supports true small caps.  If "abcdefghijklmn" are a sans-serif bold
font, this means the processor supports small caps; if those letters are
serif small caps letters, this means the document processor is faking
small caps.  The sans letters come from Source Sans Pro, available under
the exact same license as Source Serif Pro.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL!
I will not keep this up to date with the changes to Source Serif Pro.
If you want that, get Fontforge and do it yourself.

(This used to have a version of Source Serif Pro Italic, but since that
has been released, it now has the small caps version instead)
